                            The Arabic Speech Corpus for Isolated Words
Summary
_ _ _ _ _ 

 The development of the Arabic speech corpus for isolated words has been conducted at the Department of Management Information Systems, King Faisal University.  It contains about 9992 utterances of 20 words spoken by 50 native male Arabic speakers. The corpus has been made freely accessible for non-commercial use in the raw format (.wav files) and other formats. The corpus has been recorded with a 44100 Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution, as well as two channels-stereo mode.
